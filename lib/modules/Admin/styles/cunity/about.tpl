GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br />
Version 3, 19 November 2007<br />
<br />
Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br />
<http:<br />
//fsf.org/><br />
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br />
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br />
<br />
Preamble<br />
<br />
The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<br />
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure<br />
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.<br />
<br />
The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br />
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,<br />
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to<br />
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br />
software for all its users.<br />
<br />
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br />
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br />
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br />
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br />
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br />
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br />
<br />
Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights<br />
with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer<br />
you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute<br />
and/or modify the software.<br />
<br />
A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that<br />
improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they<br />
receive widespread use, become available for other developers to<br />
incorporate. Many developers of free software are heartened and<br />
encouraged by the resulting cooperation. However, in the case of<br />
software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.<br />
The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and<br />
letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its<br />
source code to the public.<br />
<br />
The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to<br />
ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available<br />
to the community. It requires the operator of a network server to<br />
provide the source code of the modified version running there to the<br />
users of that server. Therefore, public use of a modified version, on<br />
a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source<br />
code of the modified version.<br />
<br />
An older license, called the Affero General Public License and<br />
published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals. This is<br />
a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has<br />
released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under<br />
this license.<br />
<br />
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br />
modification follow.<br />
<br />
TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br />
<br />
0. Definitions.<br />
<br />
"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.<br />
<br />
"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br />
works, such as semiconductor masks.<br />
<br />
"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br />
License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and<br />
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br />
<br />
To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br />
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br />
exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br />
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br />
<br />
A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br />
on the Program.<br />
<br />
To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br />
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br />
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br />
computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,<br />
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br />
public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br />
<br />
To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br />
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through<br />
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br />
<br />
An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br />
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br />
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br />
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br />
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br />
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If<br />
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br />
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br />
<br />
1. Source Code.<br />
<br />
The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br />
for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source<br />
form of a work.<br />
<br />
A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br />
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br />
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br />
is widely used among developers working in that language.<br />
<br />
The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br />
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br />
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br />
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br />
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br />
implementation is available to the public in source code form. A<br />
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br />
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br />
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br />
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br />
<br />
The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br />
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br />
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br />
control those activities. However, it does not include the work's<br />
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br />
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br />
which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source<br />
includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br />
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br />
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br />
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br />
subprograms and other parts of the work.<br />
<br />
The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br />
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br />
Source.<br />
<br />
The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br />
same work.<br />
<br />
2. Basic Permissions.<br />
<br />
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br />
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br />
conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br />
permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a<br />
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br />
content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your<br />
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br />
<br />
You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br />
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br />
in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br />
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br />
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br />
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br />
not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works<br />
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br />
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br />
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br />
<br />
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br />
the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br />
makes it unnecessary.<br />
<br />
3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br />
<br />
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br />
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br />
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br />
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br />
measures.<br />
<br />
When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br />
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br />
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br />
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br />
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<br />
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br />
technological measures.<br />
<br />
4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br />
<br />
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br />
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br />
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br />
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br />
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br />
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br />
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br />
<br />
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br />
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br />
<br />
5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br />
<br />
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br />
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br />
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br />
<br />
a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br />
it, and giving a relevant date.<br />
<br />
b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br />
released under this License and any conditions added under section<br />
7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br />
"keep intact all notices".<br />
<br />
c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br />
License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This<br />
License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br />
additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br />
regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no<br />
permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br />
invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br />
<br />
d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br />
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br />
interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br />
work need not make them do so.<br />
<br />
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br />
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br />
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br />
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br />
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br />
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br />
beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work<br />
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br />
parts of the aggregate.<br />
<br />
6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br />
<br />
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br />
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br />
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br />
in one of these ways:<br />
<br />
a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br />
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br />
Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br />
customarily used for software interchange.<br />
<br />
b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br />
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br />
written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br />
long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br />
model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br />
copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br />
product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br />
medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br />
more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br />
conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br />
Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br />
<br />
c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br />
written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This<br />
alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br />
only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br />
with subsection 6b.<br />
<br />
d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br />
place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br />
Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br />
further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the<br />
Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to<br />
copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br />
may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br />
that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br />
clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br />
Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the<br />
Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br />
available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br />
<br />
e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br />
you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br />
Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br />
charge under subsection 6d.<br />
<br />
A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br />
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br />
included in conveying the object code work.<br />
<br />
A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br />
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br />
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br />
into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br />
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular<br />
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br />
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br />
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br />
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product<br />
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br />
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br />
the only significant mode of use of the product.<br />
<br />
"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br />
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br />
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br />
a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must<br />
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br />
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br />
modification has been made.<br />
<br />
If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br />
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br />
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br />
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br />
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br />
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br />
by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply<br />
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br />
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br />
been installed in ROM).<br />
<br />
The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br />
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br />
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br />
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a<br />
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br />
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br />
protocols for communication across the network.<br />
<br />
Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br />
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br />
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br />
source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br />
unpacking, reading or copying.<br />
<br />
7. Additional Terms.<br />
<br />
"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br />
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br />
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br />
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br />
that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions<br />
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br />
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br />
this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br />
<br />
When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br />
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br />
it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br />
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place<br />
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br />
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br />
<br />
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br />
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br />
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br />
<br />
a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br />
terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br />
<br />
b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br />
author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br />
Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br />
<br />
c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br />
requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br />
reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br />
<br />
d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br />
authors of the material; or<br />
<br />
e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br />
trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br />
<br />
f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br />
material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br />
it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br />
any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br />
those licensors and authors.<br />
<br />
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br />
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you<br />
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br />
governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br />
restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains<br />
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br />
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br />
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br />
not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br />
<br />
If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br />
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br />
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br />
where to find the applicable terms.<br />
<br />
Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br />
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br />
the above requirements apply either way.<br />
<br />
8. Termination.<br />
<br />
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br />
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br />
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br />
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br />
paragraph of section 11).<br />
<br />
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br />
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br />
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br />
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br />
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br />
prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br />
<br />
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br />
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br />
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br />
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br />
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br />
your receipt of the notice.<br />
<br />
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br />
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br />
this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br />
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br />
material under section 10.<br />
<br />
9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br />
<br />
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br />
run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br />
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br />
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,<br />
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br />
modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do<br />
not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br />
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br />
<br />
10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br />
<br />
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br />
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br />
propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible<br />
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br />
<br />
An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br />
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br />
organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered<br />
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br />
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br />
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<br />
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br />
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br />
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br />
<br />
You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br />
rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may<br />
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br />
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br />
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br />
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br />
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br />
<br />
11. Patents.<br />
<br />
A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br />
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The<br />
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<br />
<br />
A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br />
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br />
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br />
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br />
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br />
consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For<br />
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br />
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br />
this License.<br />
<br />
Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br />
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br />
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br />
propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br />
<br />
In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br />
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br />
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br />
sue for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a<br />
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br />
patent against the party.<br />
<br />
If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br />
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br />
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br />
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br />
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br />
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br />
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br />
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br />
license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means you have<br />
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br />
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<br />
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br />
country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br />
<br />
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br />
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br />
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br />
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br />
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br />
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br />
work and works based on it.<br />
<br />
A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br />
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br />
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br />
specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered<br />
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br />
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br />
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br />
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br />
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br />
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br />
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br />
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br />
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br />
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br />
<br />
Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br />
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br />
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br />
<br />
12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br />
<br />
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br />
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br />
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a<br />
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br />
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br />
not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br />
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br />
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br />
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br />
<br />
13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.<br />
<br />
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the<br />
Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users<br />
interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version<br />
supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding<br />
Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source<br />
from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary<br />
means of facilitating copying of software. This Corresponding Source<br />
shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3<br />
of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the<br />
following paragraph.<br />
<br />
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br />
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br />
under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single<br />
combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this<br />
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br />
but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version<br />
3 of the GNU General Public License.<br />
<br />
14. Revised Versions of this License.<br />
<br />
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br />
the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time. Such new versions<br />
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br />
address new problems or concerns.<br />
<br />
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the<br />
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General<br />
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br />
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br />
version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br />
Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br />
GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br />
by the Free Software Foundation.<br />
<br />
If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br />
versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's<br />
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br />
to choose that version for the Program.<br />
<br />
Later license versions may give you additional or different<br />
permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br />
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br />
later version.<br />
<br />
15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br />
<br />
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br />
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br />
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br />
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br />
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br />
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br />
IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br />
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br />
<br />
16. Limitation of Liability.<br />
<br />
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br />
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br />
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br />
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br />
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br />
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br />
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br />
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br />
SUCH DAMAGES.<br />
<br />
17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br />
<br />
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br />
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br />
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br />
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br />
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br />
copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br />
<br />
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br />
<br />
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br />
<br />
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br />
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br />
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br />
<br />
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest<br />
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br />
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br />
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br />
<br />
<one line to give the program<br />
's name and a brief idea of what it does.><br />
Copyright (C)<br />
<year><br />
    <name of author><br />
        <br />
        This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br />
        it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published<br />
        by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br />
        (at your option) any later version.<br />
        <br />
        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br />
        but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br />
        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the<br />
        GNU Affero General Public License for more details.<br />
        <br />
        You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License<br />
        along with this program. If not, see<br />
        <http:<br />
        //www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br />
        <br />
        Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br />
        <br />
        If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer<br />
        network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to<br />
        get its source. For example, if your program is a web application, its<br />
        interface could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archive<br />
        of the code. There are many ways you could offer source, and different<br />
        solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the<br />
        specific requirements.<br />
        <br />
        You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<br />
        if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<br />
        For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see<br />

<br/>
<blockquote>Preamble</blockquote>
<br/>
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br/>
freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public<br/>
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<br/>
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This<br/>
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br/>
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to<br/>
using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<br/>
the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to<br/>
your programs, too.<br/>
<br/>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br/>
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br/>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br/>
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br/>
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br/>
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br/>
<br/>
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br/>
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br/>
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<br/>
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br/>
<br/>
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br/>
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br/>
you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br/>
source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their<br/>
rights.<br/>
<br/>
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<br/>
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br/>
distribute and/or modify the software.<br/>
<br/>
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain<br/>
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br/>
software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br/>
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<br/>
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<br/>
authors' reputations.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br/>
patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<br/>
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<br/>
program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<br/>
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br/>
<br/>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br/>
modification follow.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br/>
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
</blockquote>
<br/>
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<br/>
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br/>
under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below,<br/>
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"<br/>
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br/>
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br/>
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<br/>
language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br/>
the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br/>
<br/>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br/>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of<br/>
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br/>
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<br/>
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br/>
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br/>
<br/>
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<br/>
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br/>
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br/>
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br/>
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br/>
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br/>
along with the Program.<br/>
<br/>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br/>
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br/>
<br/>
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br/>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br/>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br/>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br/>
<br/>
a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br/>
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br/>
<br/>
b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br/>
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br/>
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br/>
parties under the terms of this License.<br/>
<br/>
c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br/>
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br/>
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br/>
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br/>
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<br/>
a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<br/>
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br/>
License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br/>
does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<br/>
the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br/>
<br/>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If<br/>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br/>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br/>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br/>
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you<br/>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br/>
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br/>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br/>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br/>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br/>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br/>
collective works based on the Program.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br/>
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br/>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br/>
the scope of this License.<br/>
<br/>
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br/>
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br/>
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br/>
<br/>
a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br/>
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br/>
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br/>
<br/>
b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br/>
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br/>
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br/>
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br/>
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br/>
customarily used for software interchange; or,<br/>
<br/>
c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br/>
to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is<br/>
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br/>
received the program in object code or executable form with such<br/>
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br/>
<br/>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br/>
making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source<br/>
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br/>
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br/>
control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a<br/>
special exception, the source code distributed need not include<br/>
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br/>
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br/>
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br/>
itself accompanies the executable.<br/>
<br/>
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br/>
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br/>
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br/>
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br/>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br/>
<br/>
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br/>
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt<br/>
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br/>
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br/>
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br/>
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br/>
parties remain in full compliance.<br/>
<br/>
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br/>
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br/>
distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are<br/>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by<br/>
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br/>
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br/>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br/>
the Program or works based on it.<br/>
<br/>
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br/>
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br/>
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br/>
these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further<br/>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br/>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br/>
this License.<br/>
<br/>
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br/>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br/>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br/>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br/>
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot<br/>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br/>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br/>
may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent<br/>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br/>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br/>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br/>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br/>
<br/>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br/>
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br/>
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br/>
circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br/>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br/>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br/>
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br/>
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made<br/>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br/>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br/>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br/>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br/>
impose that choice.<br/>
<br/>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br/>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br/>
<br/>
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<br/>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br/>
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br/>
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br/>
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br/>
countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates<br/>
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br/>
<br/>
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br/>
of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will<br/>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br/>
address new problems or concerns.<br/>
<br/>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program<br/>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any<br/>
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions<br/>
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free<br/>
Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of<br/>
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<br/>
Foundation.<br/>
<br/>
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br/>
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<br/>
to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free<br/>
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<br/>
make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals<br/>
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<br/>
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>NO WARRANTY</blockquote>
<br/>
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br/>
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN<br/>
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br/>
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<br/>
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br/>
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS<br/>
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE<br/>
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<br/>
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br/>
<br/>
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br/>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<br/>
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br/>
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<br/>
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br/>
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<br/>
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<br/>
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br/>
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/>
    <br/>
    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
</blockquote>
<br/>
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br/>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br/>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br/>
<br/>
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest<br/>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br/>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br/>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br/>
<br/>
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this<br/>
when it starts in an interactive mode:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 2014 Alexander Farkas (aFarkas)<br/>

    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br/>
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

<br/>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br/>
parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may<br/>
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be<br/>
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.<br/>
<br/>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br/>
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if<br/>
necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:<br/>

    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into<br/>
    proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may<br/>
    consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the<br/>
    library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General<br/>
    Public License instead of this License.<br/>

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br/>
Version 2, June 1991<br/>
<br/>
Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,<br/>
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA<br/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br/>
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br/>
<br/>
Preamble<br/>
<br/>
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br/>
freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public<br/>
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<br/>
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This<br/>
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br/>
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to<br/>
using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<br/>
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to<br/>
your programs, too.<br/>
<br/>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br/>
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br/>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br/>
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br/>
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br/>
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br/>
<br/>
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br/>
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br/>
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<br/>
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br/>
<br/>
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br/>
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br/>
you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br/>
source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their<br/>
rights.<br/>
<br/>
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<br/>
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br/>
distribute and/or modify the software.<br/>
<br/>
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain<br/>
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br/>
software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br/>
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<br/>
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<br/>
authors' reputations.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br/>
patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<br/>
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<br/>
program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<br/>
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br/>
<br/>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br/>
modification follow.<br/>
<br/>
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br/>
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br/>
<br/>
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<br/>
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br/>
under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below,<br/>
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"<br/>
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br/>
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br/>
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<br/>
language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br/>
the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br/>
<br/>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br/>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of<br/>
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br/>
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<br/>
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br/>
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br/>
<br/>
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<br/>
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br/>
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br/>
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br/>
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br/>
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br/>
along with the Program.<br/>
<br/>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br/>
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br/>
<br/>
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br/>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br/>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br/>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br/>
<br/>
a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br/>
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br/>
<br/>
b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br/>
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br/>
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br/>
parties under the terms of this License.<br/>
<br/>
c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br/>
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br/>
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br/>
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br/>
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<br/>
a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<br/>
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br/>
License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br/>
does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<br/>
the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br/>
<br/>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If<br/>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br/>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br/>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br/>
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you<br/>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br/>
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br/>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br/>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br/>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br/>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br/>
collective works based on the Program.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br/>
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br/>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br/>
the scope of this License.<br/>
<br/>
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br/>
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br/>
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br/>
<br/>
a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br/>
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br/>
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br/>
<br/>
b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br/>
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br/>
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br/>
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br/>
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br/>
customarily used for software interchange; or,<br/>
<br/>
c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br/>
to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is<br/>
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br/>
received the program in object code or executable form with such<br/>
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br/>
<br/>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br/>
making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source<br/>
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br/>
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br/>
control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a<br/>
special exception, the source code distributed need not include<br/>
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br/>
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br/>
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br/>
itself accompanies the executable.<br/>
<br/>
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br/>
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br/>
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br/>
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br/>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br/>
<br/>
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br/>
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt<br/>
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br/>
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br/>
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br/>
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br/>
parties remain in full compliance.<br/>
<br/>
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br/>
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br/>
distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are<br/>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by<br/>
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br/>
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br/>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br/>
the Program or works based on it.<br/>
<br/>

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br/>
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if<br/>
necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:<br/>

proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may<br/>
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the<br/>
