Cunity V2.0
======
Cunity is an open-source social network that was programmed out of the need of having an own social network, which is not controlled by some big internet company. Cunity offers a variety of modules such as friends, forum, pinboard, chat, photo-gallery, messaging, etc.

With Cunity, you will always be in full control of your site's data as you can install your Cunity on your own webserver.
